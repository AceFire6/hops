# Hiphops automation engine (Hops)

Hiphops is an automation engine for dev teams.

Product info can be found on our site [hiphops.io](https://www.hiphops.io)
Full docs can be found at [docs.hiphops.io](https://docs.hiphops.io)

Hops is fully open source and can be used without hiphops.io, though this does require hosting and configuring your own NATS server and third party integrations.
hiphops.io provides a hosted NATs hub for connectivity in addition to integrations with third party services, and a suite of first party apps to solve common challenges faced by engineering teams that automate.

For most users the easiest way to get started will be using a hiphops.io account.
